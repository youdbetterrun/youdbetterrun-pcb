There are separate repositories for the firmware and 3D models.
- [Firmware](https://github.com/youdbetterrun/youdbetterrun-firmware): The code that runs on the microcontroller.
- [3D](https://github.com/youdbetterrun/youdbetterrun-3d): 3D models that need to be 3D printed and assembly instructions.
